A tiny multithreaded web server in C made for educational purposes. Additional features can be added but the goal was to simply learn the basics of POSIX sockets and threads, learn about thread pooling, mutexes, conditional variables and familiarize myself further with the C language.
# Usage
```
make
make run
make clean # to clean
```
